# HashCompare
Comfortable checksum validation for windows

A simple program which is supposed to implement a better way of validating files via checksums. 
It is espacially designed for Windows since I personally experienced a lack of good hash tools on Windows while there are several good tools on linux

Installation: Currently the program is just a batch script so you can just download and run it. 

In later versions I am planing to implement a gui. For this I am currently in the process of deciding what language to use, because my whole programm is supossed to be very lightweight

Planned and implemented features:

-   compare two files: ✅
-   compare a file with a given hash: ✅
-   compare two folders:
-   compare a folder with a given hash:
-   gui:
